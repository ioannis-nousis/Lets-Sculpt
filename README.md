 Lets-Sculpt 🎨

This repository is a personal collection of my sculpting progress and experiments, primarily done in Blender.  
Here I upload renders and snapshots of my 3D sculpts, created either from imagination or as anatomy studies.

🧠 Purpose

- To document my sculpting journey.
- To track progress over time.
- To organize character concepts and facial anatomy practices.

 📁 Structure

Images are organized by date or theme. Most of the work is original and not based on references, unless stated otherwise.

 ✍️ Notes

- Most sculpts are made from scratch and based purely on imagination.
- Files are named using automatic exports, but I include visual documentation here for reference and feedback.
- Expect frequent updates as I continue learning and creating!

 🔜 Upcoming

- Clean topology and retopology experiments
- Full-body character sculpting
- Expressions and facial animation-ready sculpts
